"""
- This example is super important â€” it explains one of the most common problems in multithreading:
- ðŸ‘‰ Race conditions, and how to prevent them using a Lock ðŸ”’
"""

# Goal of This Code
"""
- We want to increase a shared counter (a global variable) from multiple threads at the same time.
- This is a classic example to show data inconsistency problems that can happen when multiple threads modify the same variable simultaneously.

"""
[Race Condition]: When multiple threads modify shared data at once, causing wrong results.
[Lock]: Prevents race conditions by allowing only one thread at a time to access a resource.
[with lock]: Safely acquires and releases lock automatically.
