# üîç Key Concept

"""
- This code uses separate processes, not threads.

- Each process has:
    - Its own Python interpreter
    - Its own memory space
    - Its own GIL
"""

'''
‚úÖ So now, each process runs truly in parallel ‚Äî for example, one process on CPU core 1, another on CPU core 2.

| Feature                           | Multithreading              | Multiprocessing                                          

| **Library Used**                  | `threading`                   | `multiprocessing`
                                    
| **Memory**                        | Shared memory (same process space)    | Separate memory for each process 

| **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** | Affects performance ‚Äî only one thread runs at a time   | Not affected ‚Äî each process has its own GIL            |

| **Best For**                      | I/O-bound tasks (e.g., downloading files, network calls) | CPU-bound tasks (e.g., calculations, image processing) |

| **Overhead**                      | Lightweight (fast to start)   | Heavy (needs to create newprocesses) |

| **True Parallelism**              | ‚ùå No (GIL prevents it)               | ‚úÖ Yes (each process runs independently)
