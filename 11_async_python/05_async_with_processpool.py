"""
this example shows how you can combine asyncio with ProcessPoolExecutor to offload CPU-heavy work to another process while keeping your main program responsive.

# Asynchronous main coroutine

    # Create a pool of separate processes (not threads)
    # This is useful for CPU-heavy tasks, so each process can use its own CPU core
    with ProcessPoolExecutor() as pool:

        # Run the blocking CPU-heavy function in a separate process
        # 'loop.run_in_executor()' submits the task to the process pool
        # It returns a coroutine that we can await
        result = await loop.run_in_executor(pool, encrypt, "credit_card_1234")

# Entry point â€” run the async main function
