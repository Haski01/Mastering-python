# ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Happening Behind the Scenes

"""
- check_stock() is a normal blocking function â€” it uses time.sleep(3) (which halts the thread for 3 seconds).
    - Normally, this would freeze the whole async program if run directly.

- asyncio.get_running_loop() grabs the event loop that controls async execution.
- ThreadPoolExecutor() creates a pool of background threads.

- loop.run_in_executor(pool, check_stock, "Masala chai")
    â†’ This runs the blocking function in one of those background threads.
    â†’ The main async loop stays free and responsive.

- await waits for the thread to finish and then returns the result.
- Finally, the result is printed â€” "Masala chai stock: 42".
"""

# â˜• Real-life Analogy
"""
- Imagine youâ€™re a shopkeeper managing many customers:
    - A customer asks you to check stock in the backroom (takes 3 mins).
    - Instead of going yourself and making other customers wait (blocking),
      you send a helper (thread) to check it for you while you serve others.

- Thatâ€™s what run_in_executor() does â€” runs blocking work in another thread without pausing your async loop.
